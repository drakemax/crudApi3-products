# crudApi3-products
Thisd follows the crud tutorial: 
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJetLDY7yKupm5WTx02ylh1I25rJLPvXe
and the code works, its linked to firebase project crudApi3 and the associated database. 

The same code is being used for the expenses app & links to the same project & database. 
I'll use a different collection for that to the database

This is more an archive for running code. 

Run > npm run serve FROM the Functions directory
This has collection product  with id(number) for collection of name, description , price
